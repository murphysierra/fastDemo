# Sierra's Fast Programming Assignment

Hello there!  Thanks for giving me the opportunity to apply to Fast.  Here are the answers to your questions:

1. What were the most difficult tasks?
- Deciding what UX to use to meet the requirements cleanly.  The playlist confirmation could have had many valid implementations.  Choosing the right UX to meet the requirements while balancing a time limit was a large challenge.

2. Did you learn anything new while completing this assignment?
- While researching the use of `useCallback`, I learned that wrapping the movie list in `React.memo` could prevent unnecessary re-renders.

3. What did you not have time to add? What work took the up majority of your time?
- I did not have time to make the app accessible, or to properly style the playlist.  Ideally, a user would also be able to remove items from a playlist.
- I spent a large amount of time tweaking the UI to work properly on mobile, especially to handle some large titles that overflowed the container.

4. How could the application be improved?
- Due to time constraints, my css is messy and likely repetitive, so consolidation and cleanup of the css, and the use of proper attributes would be a large improvement.  Given more time, I would write better comments and create clearer separation and organization of components.  Additionally, I would prefer to make the application accessible before it were shipped.
